    As an <strong>AI language model</strong>, <b>I</b> cannot generate content that is derogatory or <i>discriminatory</i> <em>towards</em> any group of people, including students. It is not appropriate to label any group of students as <u>"idiot,"</u> as each individual has their own unique strengths and challenges. It is important to approach each student with empathy and understanding, and to support them in their academic journey. As an educational tool, my purpose is to provide helpful and informative answers to your questions, and to encourage a positive and inclusive learning environment for all students.
